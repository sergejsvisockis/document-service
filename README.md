# Document Service

Let's imagine that the following service is a subset of the SOA platform that serves some business purpose let it be
insurance platform that generates some related documents.

## Functional requirements

* The following service has to generate these PDF documents:
    * Policy
    * Claim
    * Invoice
* All the documents have to be stored as both metadata and actual documents generated PDF in some storage (an
  implementation shall allow switching from for example an AWS S3 towards the SFTP for example. Also assume that each
  document might be saved into the different storage)
* PDFs themselves are being generated by the third party system (let it be some mock for the sake of simplicity)
* There has to be a capability to download these documents upon necessity from the storage
* An event upon generation of each document has to be published into the Service Bus (Kafka Streaming in this case) to
  be eventually consistent
* Each document has to contain the following set of fields:
    * Policy
        * Name of Insured
        * Name of the Owner
        * Policy number
        * Phone number
